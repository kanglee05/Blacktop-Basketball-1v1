Blacktop Basketball 1v1 Game

User can choose the difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) and winning score (up to 15).

There are 4 levels on offense: 3-point line, mid-range, floater, layup/dunk.

User starts at 3-point line at start of the game. Has option to shoot, dribble, or crossover.

Dribble moves the user one level closer (ex: 3-point line to mid-range), crossover moves the user two levels closer.

Probability of successfully making the shot increases the closer the user is to the basket.

Computer has probability to steal the ball depending on the difficulty level chosen by the user.

Happy playing :)
